## Background Context
Old-school system administrators usually only know Bash and<br> that is what they use to build their scripts. While Bash<br> is perfectly fine for a lot of things, it can quickly get messy and<br> not efficient compared to other programming languages.<br> The new generation of system administrators, usually called SREs, are<br> pretty much regular software engineers but instead<br> of building products, they are managing systems. And one of the big<br> differences with their predecessors is that they know more than just Bash<br> scripting.

One popular way to expose an application and dataset is<br> to use an API. Often, they are the public facing part of<br> websites and micro-services so that allow outsiders to interact with them – <br>access and modify their data. In this project,<br> you will access employee data via an API to organize and export them to different<br> data structures.
This is a perfect example of a task that is not suited for Bash<br> scripting, so let’s build Python scripts.
